Students who have taken courses in Asian and Middle Eastern Languages and Studies have gone on to careers and graduate education in a wide range of fields, from business and government to education and the media. In addition to language skills, our programs provide students with career-related skills that will prove useful in many professions; such as written and oral communication, multicultural and interpersonal skills, analytic and creative thinking, and research and information literacy.
