## Study Abroad

We strongly encourage our students to study for a semester or more in one of the countries they learn about in the Arabic, Asian Studies, Chinese, and Japanese curriculums. Study abroad that includes participation in an intensive language program is an especially valuable way for students to develop a high level of proficiency in the language they are studying. These programs are designed to improve participants’ oral, listening, reading, and writing proficiency in their target language as well as developing their knowledge regarding the history, politics, culture and society of that country. Combining intensive language classes with experience abroad prepares students to compete for careers on a global level. Credits earned through the study abroad programs may be used toward a minor and/or certificate.

- Foreign Language Placement, Waiver, and Assessment Requests:

For questions about placement, waivers, and assessments, please see the appropriate Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Hebrew, Hindi, or Korean advisor.  For languages that are not taught at Temple or that are taught outside of the department, please contact [Ms. Peggy Shadding](mailto:peggy.shadding@temple.edu) for information.

For languages not offered at the university, students have the option of taking an Alta Services Translation Assessment Exam. Students should print the form Foreign Language Assessment Request and Certification and complete the first two sections, “Student Identification Information” and “Language Background and Information.” Students should next meet with an advisor, bringing this form as well as any relevant documentation, such as a transcript or diploma, to demonstrate their background in the assessment language. Students should then create an account and pay for the exam service online at [www.altatesting.com/purchase](www.altatesting.com/purchase) using group code TMPL. Once registered, students may then set up a time with Ms. Shadding for the exam to be proctored in her office. The exam is conducted orally via telephone.
