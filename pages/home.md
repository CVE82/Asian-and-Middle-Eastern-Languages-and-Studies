The Department of Asian and Middle Eastern Languages and Studies offers majors in Asian Studies and Chinese, minors in Arabic, Asian Studies, Chinese, and Japanese, certificates of language proficiency in Arabic, Chinese, and Japanese, and a certificate in Asian Business and Society. We also offer instruction in Hebrew, Hindi and Korean. We help students develop the language skills and cultural knowledge needed for careers and professions that range from business and government to education and the media. Our courses taught in English on literature, film and culture also provide rigorous academic training for those interested in going on to graduate studies and professional degree programs. The popular minor and certificate programs complement most majors at the university, including Asian Studies and Global Studies.

## BOX NUMBER 1 [Study Abroad In Asia And The Middle East](http://studyabroad.temple.edu/) 

We strongly encourage our students to study for a  semester or more in one of the countries they learn about  in the Arabic, Asian Studies, Chinese, and Japanese  curriculums. Study abroad that includes participation in an intensive language program is an especially valuable way for students to develop a high level of proficiency in the  language they are studying.

## BOX NUMBER 2 [Connect With The World Around You](https://www.ciee.org/)

In addition to language proficiency, our courses help  students develop a deep understanding of East Asia and the Middle East. They learn the skills needed to connect globally.

## BOX NUMBER 3 Study Literature, Film And Popular Culture

Asian and Middle Eastern Languages and Studies courses in literature, film and popular culture — all given in translation — invite students from any major to develop familiarity with the cultures of China, Japan, and the Middle East.
