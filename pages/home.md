The Department of Asian and Middle Eastern Languages and Studies offers programs leading to an undergraduate minor or certificate of language proficiency in Arabic, Chinese, and Japanese. The department also offers instruction in Hebrew, Hindi, and Korean. Our programs are designed to provide the language skills and cultural knowledge needed for a number of professions and careers.  

Every semester the department offers several courses on topics such as literature, film, and culture which are taught in English and utilize translated materials. These provide rigorous academic training for those interested in pursuing graduate studies and professional degrees.
