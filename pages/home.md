The Department of Asian and Middle Eastern Languages and Studies offers majors in Asian Studies and Chinese, minors in Arabic, Asian Studies, Chinese, and Japanese, certificates of language proficiency in Arabic, Chinese, and Japanese, and a certificate in Asian Business and Society. We also offer instruction in Hebrew, Hindi and Korean. We help students develop the language skills and cultural knowledge needed for careers and professions that range from business and government to education and the media. Our courses taught in English on literature, film and culture also provide rigorous academic training for those interested in going on to graduate studies and professional degree programs. The popular minor and certificate programs complement most majors at the university, including Asian Studies and Global Studies.
